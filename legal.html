                <p>Measures aimed at the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing will require a Purchaser to verify their identity and/or the source of funds. This procedure may apply on any or all of the following:</p>

                <p>Each Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that any failure by them to comply with the requests of Digital Currensy in relation to measures aimed at the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, may result in action being taken against the Purchaser in respect to platform usage, without limitation, the suspension or withdrawal of the Purchaserâ€™s account on the Digital Currensy platform or their Digital Currensy Cash being seized.</p>
